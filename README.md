### [Rebuilding Rails](https://rebuilding-rails.com/)
##### by Raymond Gan

My version of "Rebuilding Rails" by Noah Gibbs, one of the best, most in-depth books on Rails I've ever read. I build a simple version of Rails, completely from SCRATCH. In the process, I:

- Thoroughly investigate Rack
- Learn how Ruby metaprogramming works in Rails
- Create my own routing system
- Learn how Rails automatically loads controllers
- Create controllers/videos/models from scratch
- Learn about request/response
- Create my own Object-Relational Mapping to talk to a database, and
- Learn about Rack middleware.

"With Rebuilding Rails, you'll build an MVC web framework, structured like Rails and using the same underlying libraries and tricks. You'll learn the magic behind Rails. You'll finish each system and solidify your knowledge with structured exercises. And you'll understand Rails like only a framework builder can."

For more juicy learning, see [Owning Rails](http://owningrails.com/), an 8 hour online course by Marc-Andr√© Cournoyer.
